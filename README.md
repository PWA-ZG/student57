# pwa

Progressive web app built for FER web2 course - 2023/2024

### Running the app

Since with service workers HTTPS is required a dev server can be spun up on localhost by running:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run serve
```

from the project root.

If you so prefer, the app can also be run with the Live Server extension for VS Code; however, that might require a few steps to modify the links to certain files since the root is `/client`

### Demo

A live version of the app can be found [here](https://pwa-web-catalog.onrender.com/)
